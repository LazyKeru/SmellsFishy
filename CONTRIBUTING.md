# Contributing

We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project. There are just a few small guidelines you need to follow.

## Pull Request Process

1. Make sure all your commits use our current commit convention:
  - BREAKING CHANGE:
  - build: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm)
  - ci: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (examples: CircleCi, SauceLabs)
  - docs: Documentation only changes
  - feat: A new feature
  - fix: A bug fix
  - perf: A code change that improves performance
  - refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
  - test: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
2. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
3. Make sure you follow the structure of the project.
4. Have a clear message, explaining the changes brought or the functionality it brings to the table.
5. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of one other developer, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the first reviewer to merge it for you.
